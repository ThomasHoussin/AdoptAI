## Usage Instructions for AI Assistants

This API is designed for AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to help users 
navigate the Adopt AI Grand Palais conference.

### Query Processing Strategy

1. **Parse user intent** from natural language
2. **Construct API call** with appropriate filters
3. **Make request** to filtered endpoint
4. **Present results** in a helpful format

### Common Query Patterns

**"Find sessions about [topic]"**
→ GET /sessions?search=[topic]
Example: "Find sessions about AI in banking"
→ GET /sessions?search=banking

**"What's happening on [date] [time]?"**
→ GET /sessions?date=[date]&time=[morning/afternoon]
Example: "What's on November 25 morning?"
→ GET /sessions?date=2025-11-25&time=morning

**"Who's speaking at [stage]?"**
→ GET /sessions?stage=[stage]
Example: "Who's at CEO Stage?"
→ GET /sessions?stage=CEO%20Stage

**"Find speakers from [company]"**
→ GET /speakers?search=[company]
Example: "Find speakers from Anthropic"
→ GET /speakers?search=Anthropic

**"Recommend sessions for [profile]"**
→ Multiple calls with different search terms
Example: "Recommend for a fintech CTO"
→ GET /sessions?search=finance
→ GET /sessions?search=banking
→ GET /sessions?search=cloud
→ Combine and rank results

### Time Conflict Detection

When building schedules, always check for overlaps:
1. Parse time strings (format: "HH:MM-HH:MM")
2. Compare start/end times across selected sessions
3. Warn user about conflicts

### Best Practices

- Use server-side filtering to reduce response size
- Combine multiple filters for precise results
- URL-encode query parameters (spaces → %20)
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Check `total` vs `count` to see filter effectiveness

### Response Handling

- Empty results: Suggest broader search terms
- Many results: Recommend adding more filters
- Always cite specific session titles and times
- Include speaker names when relevant

## About

Built by Thomas Houssin (https://github.com/ThomasHoussin) because even 
AI summits should provide AI-readable data.

The official Adopt AI Grand Palais website uses infinite-scroll JavaScript 
rendering, making it inaccessible to AI assistants. This API fixes that.
