# Adopt AI Grand Palais 2025 - AI-Friendly API

> REST API for the Adopt AI Grand Palais conference schedule
> 240+ sessions • 200+ speakers • Nov 25-26, 2025 • Paris

## Base URL

https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr

## Usage Instructions for AI Assistants

This API is designed for AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to help users 
navigate the Adopt AI Grand Palais conference.

### Query Processing Strategy

1. **Parse user intent** from natural language
2. **Construct API call** with appropriate filters
3. **Make request** to filtered endpoint
4. **Present results** in a helpful format

### Data Access Methods

**Primary Method (Preferred): Direct API Access**

If you can make HTTP requests (via WebFetch, browser tools, or other capabilities):
- Use the API endpoints directly as documented above
- This provides real-time filtered data and optimal performance
- Example: Fetch https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/sessions?search=banking

**Fallback Method: User-Provided Data**

If you cannot access external URLs (common limitation when URL is not provided by
user or found via web search), use this fallback strategy:

1. **Explain the limitation** to the user clearly:
   "I don't have direct access to the API URL. To help you effectively, I need
   the complete dataset."

2. **Request the URLs or the data** from the user:
   "Please copy these URLs in the chat window, or visit these URLs and copy/paste the complete JSON response:
   - Sessions: https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/sessions
   - Speakers: https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/speakers"

3. **Process the data** once provided:
   - Parse the JSON data the user provides
   - Apply filters and search logic locally
   - Present results in the same helpful format

**Why this fallback works:**
- You can access the URLs if given by the user
- The full dataset is small enough to be copied/pasted (~500KB total)
- Allows you to perform all filtering and analysis client-side
- Ensures users still get comprehensive help even without direct API access
- Sessions endpoint returns all 240+ sessions in a single request
- Speakers endpoint returns all 200+ speakers in a single request

**When to use each method:**
- ✅ Use API directly: When you have URL access or user provides the API URL
- ✅ Use fallback: When you cannot access external URLs independently
- ❌ Never: Refuse to help or claim you cannot access the data

### Common Query Patterns

**"What's happening right now?" / "What sessions are starting soon?"**
→ GET https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/sessions?now=true
Returns:
- Sessions currently ongoing (started and not yet finished)
- Sessions starting within the next 30 minutes
Uses Paris timezone (Europe/Paris)

**"Find sessions about [topic]"**
→ GET https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/sessions?search=[topic]
Example: "Find sessions about AI in banking"
→ GET https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/sessions?search=banking

**"What's happening on [date] [time]?"**
→ GET https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/sessions?date=[date]&time=[morning/afternoon]
Example: "What's on November 25 morning?"
→ GET https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/sessions?date=2025-11-25&time=morning

**"Who's speaking at [stage]?"**
→ GET https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/sessions?stage=[stage]
Example: "Who's at CEO Stage?"
→ GET https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/sessions?stage=CEO%20Stage

**"Find speakers from [company]"**
→ GET https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/speakers?search=[company]
Example: "Find speakers from Anthropic"
→ GET https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/speakers?search=Anthropic

**"Recommend sessions for [profile]"**
→ Multiple calls with different search terms
Example: "Recommend for a fintech CTO"
→ GET https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/sessions?search=finance
→ GET https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/sessions?search=banking
→ GET https://adoptai.codecrafter.fr/sessions?search=cloud
→ Combine and rank results

### Time Conflict Detection

When building schedules, always check for overlaps:
1. Parse time strings (format: "HH:MM-HH:MM")
2. Compare start/end times across selected sessions
3. Warn user about conflicts

### Best Practices

- Use server-side filtering to reduce response size
- Combine multiple filters for precise results
- URL-encode query parameters (spaces → %20)
- Cache responses when appropriate
- Check `total` vs `count` to see filter effectiveness

### Response Handling

- Empty results: Suggest broader search terms
- Many results: Recommend adding more filters
- Always cite specific session titles and times
- Include speaker names when relevant

## About

Built by Thomas Houssin (https://github.com/ThomasHoussin) because even 
AI summits should provide AI-readable data.

The official Adopt AI Grand Palais website uses infinite-scroll JavaScript 
rendering, making it inaccessible to AI assistants. This API fixes that.
